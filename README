Web - template and web app for creating and running Mechanical Turk HITs as External Questions 


Backend - command line tools for interacting with MTurk API and creating HITs in MTurk

RUN ONCE:
	voc-load-db-pipeline.py
		populates list of languages based on settings file
		loads vocabularies from /data/input folder (prepared by wikilanguages-pipeline)
		loads dictionaries for QA from /data/input folder (prepared by wikilanguages-pipeline)

    generate-images-pipeline.py
		generates images for all vocabulary and dictionary items
	
	java  -Djava.awt.headless=true generateimages sentences.txt segments.txt images
		renders PNG files
		10MB of images per 1000 words+sentences

	voc-hit-generate.py
		generates batches of vocabulary HITs in database

	voc-hit-pipeline.py
		generates HITs in MTurk and reference them to batches of words in database
		
		
RUN CONTINUOUSLY:
		
	
	get-assignments.py
		tasks retreives all completed assignments from voc HIT and loads results into vocabularyhitsresults table


// need manually create entry in language table for "en":"English"
		
	syn-hits-generate.py
		takes processed results from Voc HIT (from vochitsresults table) and populates syn hits and syn hits data table 
		task can be run multiple times without creating duplicates
		
	syn-hits-pipeline.py
		generates HITs in MTurk and reference them to batches in database
	
	
	get-assignments2.py
		tasks retreives all completed assignments from synonyms HIT and loads results into synonymshitsresults table
		
	
	review-step2.py
		review results of step2

		HOW IT WORKS:
			for all assignments:
				+review if passed/failed based on control
				+mark assignments as passed/failed
				+go to MTurk and accept/reject assignments as needed
				+add extra assignment for each rejected assignment to corresponding HITs

			for all HITs:
				-if # of accepted assignments=3 do something with all the QA data and pass it to step 1

	review-step1.py
